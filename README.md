Introduction
This project demonstrates how to process large-scale sales data using Hadoop MapReduce and visualize the results using Python. MapReduce aggregates the sales data, and Python provides graphical representations, making it easier to interpret the top-performing mobile brands.

Features
Uses Hadoop MapReduce to aggregate total sales revenue by mobile brand.
Visualizes the top 20 mobile brands based on total revenue using Python.
Suitable for large datasets that require distributed computing for efficient processing.
Technologies
Hadoop MapReduce for distributed data processing.
Python for data visualization.
pandas and matplotlib libraries for creating clear and readable plots.
Installation
Prerequisites
Hadoop installed and running (tested with Hadoop 3.x).
Python 3.10+ installed.
Install the required Python libraries.
